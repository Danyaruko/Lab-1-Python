To run the program, unzip the archive, open command line terminal(if you aren't sure about it, you ought to read the guide:https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-guide-to-using-command-line-terminal-96815b97b955), change active directory to where archive's content is located and type in "python main.py", "python3 main.py" or "py main.py".
